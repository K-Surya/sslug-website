            I was introduced to computers early on but I never really saw them more than just "devices". My perspective changed when I learnt to code (I started with BASIC as it was a part of my school's curriculum) and I realised that computers were more than devices from which you can access the internet and play games, but rather a powerful tool capable of performing mundane human tasks.

        <p>I started off with Ubuntu on my school computers. My interest in Linux grew in 2020 and I started by installing Ubuntu on my Laptop. About 5 years later, I use EndeavourOS with the KDE desktop environment. I mostly use Linux for all my programming projects and for experimenting with my computer.</p>
